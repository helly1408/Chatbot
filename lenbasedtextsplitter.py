text=""" The old bookstore at the corner of Maple Street had a charm that couldnâ€™t be replicated. Dusty shelves stretched from floor to ceiling, crammed with novels, journals, and forgotten tales waiting to be rediscovered. A bell above the door chimed softly whenever someone entered, breaking the silence like a whisper. The scent of aged paper mixed with the faint aroma of coffee from the back room, where a cat named Whiskers often lounged on a sunny windowsill. It was a place where time seemed to slow down, inviting visitors to lose themselves in the magic of words and imagination."""
